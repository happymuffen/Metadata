Android app to automaticly read barcodes and show associated relevent information.
Requires camera and internet permissions.

This is a personal project that I'm working on in my free time. I am using google's vision api and associated code from googlesamples to handle the camera and barcode aquisition.

I am fumbling through this and have no idea what I'm doing about half the time. Everything is fine. Do not panic.

If for whatever reason you want to use my code, I would like to be credited. Otherwise, have at it.
